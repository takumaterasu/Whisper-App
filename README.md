I built a native macOS app using Cursor that automatically generates subtitles thanks to OpenAIâ€™s Whisper model.

The transcription is super accurate when you keep the original language of the video.
If you switch to another language, some words can feel a bit too literally translated â€” but overall, it works surprisingly well.

On first launch, the app will ask to download the needed dependencies and the Whisper model (~1.5 GB).
After that, everything runs locally, no internet required.

ðŸ§  Works only on macOS Sequoia (15+)
